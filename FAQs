# 🛡️ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Does cultured meat cause cancer?
**No.** This is a fundamental biological misunderstanding used for political scaremongering.
* **The Science:** Cultured meat is grown from normal animal stem cells (satellite cells). While these cells replicate quickly in a bioreactor, they are not malignant.
* **Digestive Safety:** Human digestion breaks down animal cells into amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides. It is biologically impossible for a cell's growth characteristics to "transfer" to a human through consumption.

### Q2: What is "FGF2-G3" and is it safe to eat?
**Yes.** FGF2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2) is a protein that occurs naturally in almost all living animals.
* **Role:** It is a biological signal for cell repair and growth.
* **Safety:** The "G3" variant is a thermostable version of the natural protein, optimized for efficiency. Like any protein in steak or eggs, it is digested into standard amino acids. It is not a synthetic chemical or a steroid.

### Q3: Why is cultured meat considered "cleaner" than traditional meat?
Cultured meat is grown in a **sterile, closed-system environment**.
* **No Antibiotics:** Because the environment is sterile, there is no need for the prophylactic antibiotics used in industrial ranching.
* **No Pathogens:** There is zero risk of fecal contamination (*E. coli*, *Salmonella*), zoonotic diseases (Bird Flu), or environmental mercury/toxins.

### Q4: Why is the >50% Oleic Acid target important?
Conventional industrial beef is often high in saturated fats. By targeting **Oleic Acid** (the healthy fat found in olive oil), we create a product that is:
1. **Heart-Healthy:** Reducing cardiovascular risks associated with traditional red meat.
2. **Flavor-Superior:** Replicating the "melt-in-your-mouth" texture of high-end Wagyu beef.

### Q5: Why is this research being made Open-Source?
Because food security and animal welfare are global issues that shouldn't be controlled by corporate patents or blocked by protectionist state laws. Open-sourcing ensures that the science is transparent, peer-reviewed, and accessible to everyone, everywhere.
