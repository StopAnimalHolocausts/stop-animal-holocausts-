## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the verified genetic blueprints, media formulations, and 3D-bioprinting parameters required to produce cultivated beef at price parity with traditional ranching. Our mission is to bypass protectionist legislation and "meat taxes" by providing researchers worldwide with the tools to end animal suffering through science.

## 🧪 Core Technologies

### 1. FGF2-G3: The "Weekend-Free" Growth Factor
* **Purpose:** 90% cost reduction in media by replacing standard FGF2 with a thermostable variant.
* **Key Advantage:** Remains stable at $37$°C for several days, eliminating the need for daily media changes.
* **Genetic Source:** Optimized for expression in *L. lactis* or *E. coli* for food-grade production.

### 2. Beefy-9+Lipid (B9-L) Media Strategy
A serum-free formulation designed for high-density suspension growth and lipid enrichment.

| Component | Concentration | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Oleic Acid (C18:1)** | $300$ μM | Target: >50% MUFA for premium flavor. |
| **Stearic Acid (C18:0)** | $60$ μM | Provides structural firmness and mouthfeel. |
| **FGF2-G3** | $40$ ng/mL | Primary mitogen for muscle expansion. |
| **RPI Conjugate** | 3:1 Molar Ratio | Rapeseed Protein Isolate carrier for lipid uptake. |

## 🖨️ 3D Bioprinting Parameters
**Technique:** FRESH (Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels)

* **Nozzle:** $400$–$600$ μm (Tapered)
* **Pressure:** $15$–$35$ kPa
* **Infill Pattern:** Sinusoidal (to mimic natural bovine marbling)
* **Crosslinker:** $50$ mM $CaCl_2$

## 🏛️ Regulatory & Political Context (2026)
This research is released in response to local protectionist laws (e.g., Arizona HB 2791) that seek to criminalize the sale of cell-cultured protein. We believe that **Food Sovereignty** is a human right. By decentralizing these protocols, we ensure that no single government can "ban" the future of ethical protein.

### Anti-"Meat Tax" Strategy
By achieving production costs of **<$5/lb**, this technology acts as a market release valve against the rising inflation of conventional beef ($10+/lb).

## 🤝 How to Contribute
We are looking for collaborators in:
* **Bioprocess Engineering:** Scaling to $500$L+ bioreactors.
* **Genetics:** CRISPR-optimized suspension cell lines (e.g., TU-GFI-SCL1).
* **Public Policy:** Legal challenges against unconstitutional state-level bans.
